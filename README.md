# **HANGMAN WORD GUESSING GAME**

# INTRODUCTION

![AmIResponsive Screenshot]()

This programme is a digital version of Hangman, the popular game believed to have started in the 17th Century.

It is a Command Line Interface Application designed for a single User to play this classic game. It has three levels of difficulty and a random level, in which a word of any level can be picked.

The game was designed so that anyone can play it, from children to adults. The aim is to improve the User's vocabulary and spelling abilities in a way that is interactive and doesn't feel boring.

# USER EXPERIENCE

## USER'S STORIES

### PRIMARY GOAL

The main goal this programme was built for was to provide Users with a digital alternative to the Hangman game.

This aim of the game is that over time the User improves their spelling and vocabulary in a dynamic fashion.

### VISITOR GOALS

The application was created to be used by people who enjoy playing this type of game.

The User can choose a difficulty level at the beginning, and once the game has completed they are asked if they want to replay. This also gives them the ability to choose a different difficulty.

#### FIRST TIME VISITORS

First time visitors will:

- Be able to add their name at the start
- Read the instructions before starting
- Know how many chances they have to guess the word (lives)
- Choose a difficulty level
- Guess a letter they think is in the word
- Depending on the outcome of the game they will get a different message
- Have the ability to have another game

#### RETURNING VISITORS

Returning visitors will still have the same cues and messages as a first time User.

The numbers for each level are always the same, so as soon as they type their name and press the Enter key they are able to choose the level they want, and don't have to read the instructions each time before selecting.

#### FREQUENT VISIORS

A frequent visitor will know the structure and how the game works. They shouldn't feel the need to read through the instructions and would know which number corresponds to each level.

There are

Due to there only being around twenty different words to choose from in the Hard level, a frequent user who enjoys the game and is good at it might feel like they've gone through all the options.

The different levels aim to address this, however the intention is to add more words to the accompanying txt files.

## FUTURE FEATURES

The game can be played by anyone, and more words will be added to the accompanying txt files in future.

so that there is a larger selection of words to choose from, thus minimising any feeling of repetitiveness from a User who enjoys playing the game and does frequently.
