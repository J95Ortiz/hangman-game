###FUNCTIONS:
###introduction() - Gets user's name and level desired
###word_choice() - Takes the result from introduction() and chooses a word from the corresponding txt file. Then assigns it the variable name "game_word"
###hide_word() - Creates a new variable "blank" which is a string that has as many "_" as "game_word" has letters. "blank" is assignedd the variable "hidden_word" outside the fn when called

###VARIABLES
###easy = open("easy.txt", "r")
###medium = open("medium.txt", "r")
