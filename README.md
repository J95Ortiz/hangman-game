# **HANGMAN WORD GUESSING GAME**

# INTRODUCTION

![AmIResponsive Screenshot]()

This programme is a digital version of Hangman, the popular game believed to have started in the 17th Century.

It is a Command Line Interface Application designed for a single User to play this classic game. It has three levels of difficulty and a random level, in which a word of any level can be picked.

The game was designed so that anyone can play it, from children to adults. The aim is to improve the User's vocabulary and spelling abilities in a way that is interactive and doesn't feel boring.
